Yaw-Pitch-Roll Pose Estimation Project

Overview
This project aims to estimate the yaw, pitch, and roll angles of an object in an image or video frame. Yaw, pitch, and roll are rotational angles that describe the orientation of an object in three-dimensional space. Accurate estimation of these angles is essential for various applications such as robotics, augmented reality, and computer vision.

Features
Yaw, Pitch, and Roll Estimation: The core functionality of this project is to estimate the yaw, pitch, and roll angles of an object in an image or video frame.
Multiple Input Sources: The project supports both image and video inputs, allowing for real-time or batch processing.
Robust Pose Estimation: The pose estimation algorithm is designed to be robust against variations in lighting conditions, object textures, and background clutter.
Easy-to-Use Interface: The project provides a user-friendly interface for both running the pose estimation algorithm and visualizing the results.
Modular Design: The codebase is structured in a modular way, making it easy to extend or modify for different applications or integration into larger projects.
